OpenPLC is an open hardware alternative for industrial and home automation. It uses the well known ATmega chips as main processor, the same used on Arduino. This means that OpenPLC is code-compatible with all arduino sketches.


Features:


● Protected 24V Digital Inputs (8 for each module)

● Protected 24V Digital Outputs (8 for each module)

● USB Communication (used for programming)

● RS-485 bus for modules communication

● Open Source IDE with c++ programming

● Open Source IDE with Ladder programming

● Integrated Ethernet

● 16MHz ATmega328P as main processor
